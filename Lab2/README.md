# Goal

In this work I did two algorithms to solve system of linear matrices:

- [Gaussian method](https://github.com/mezgoodle/numericalMethods_labs/blob/master/Lab2/gaussian.py)

- [Square root method](https://github.com/mezgoodle/numericalMethods_labs/blob/master/Lab2/squareRoot.py)

## Libraries

In this work I used [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) to check my answers.
