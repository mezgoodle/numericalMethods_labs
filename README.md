# numericalMethods_labs
My labs for numerical methods in KPI

## Installation

You can just [download](https://github.com/mezgoodle/numericalMethods_labs/archive/master.zip) this code like zip archive, then unzip and use.

## Architecture

> Links to example files

There are main files, that used in every lab

* [*.py](https://github.com/mezgoodle/numericalMethods_labs/blob/master/Lab1/main.py) - Main file, where program is set.

* [checker](https://github.com/mezgoodle/numericalMethods_labs/blob/master/checker/main.py) - File, that helps me to compare data from functions, which there aren't in NumPy.
